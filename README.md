# **What is React?**

React is a library created by Meta (previously Facebook) and has gained popularity as one of the big three popular web frameworks (the others being Angular and Vue). It follows a declarative, component-based approach and doesn't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, furthering a learn once, write anywhere learning mindset.

In recent years, the industry has pivoted from the older and more traditional class-based components to the newer functional-based components with hooks. This newer way of writing components is easier to read, test and implement best practices, because they are simply plain Javascript functions calling other functions.

## **Why should I learn about it?**

One of its most significant advantages is that it is relatively tech agnostic and allows teams to compose their applications with technology choices that make sense for the application they are building.

## **Fragments**

One of the most useful features introduced by React 16 is Fragments because React components are required to have only one root element. React 16 introduced the React. Fragment wrapper allows child component wrapping, meaning that an element can have multiple child elements at its root, with one parent element, the Fragment, which does not get rendered to the DOM. React. Fragments help alleviate the DOM nesting that React < 16 was prone to due to having to wrap the contents of an element with multiple root elements in something else, like a div.

# **Basic React Tutorial**

Facebook's React Tutorial is an excellent starting place, as it covers theoretical and practical aspects of React. Completing Facebook's React tutorial shouldn't take more than a day.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After going through the practical, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

- [ ] ES 6
- [ ] JSX
- [ ] React application State and Lifecycle
- [ ] Handling events
- [ ] React functional components
- [ ] Hoisting State
- [ ] NPM
